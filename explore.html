            trying hard to
            get an sarkari naukari. By ignoring my english let's move forwad towards my studies, hobbies, activities and
            others.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            I have completed my primary education in a local nagarnigam school and secondary education in RPVV Surajmal
            Vihar School and for me that's best school in delhi umm... until principal changes because after that a huge
            change we have faced that HOHO bus was removed for picnic and that old woamting bus came forwad. okay lets
            ignore this come again to my education.
            So, During school I have done ITI in Automobile Workshop & Repair and I am pretty goood in this subject
            atleast more than my current subject that I'm studying is Political Science Honours from PGDAV(Ps. I don't
            know full form) College Evening.
            and ya I'm also a UPSC Aspirant (Majboori hai). However, I'm thinking to continue my further studies if
            possible.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        <p>
            I love to do extra things apart from my boring studies that's why I have learnt Video editing, Photoshop,
            Software & still learning C++, Front-end Web Development, Android Studio Development, Animation.
            Furher more I love playing video games mobile & pc both and I've discovered most of games but due to low
            specs i'm not unable to play high-end triple A games that i love.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            No Experience. But I have done 1 month intership in Automobile Workshop at TATA MOTORS. I am not earning
            even a single rupees from anywhere but when i will find work that suit for me i will do if possible till I
            am just studying and learning. also I had a youtube channel but i deleted that because i was not intersted
            at all & just started for fame like others were doing to gain subscribers.
